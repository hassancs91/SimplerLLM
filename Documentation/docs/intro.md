## Setup SimplerLLM

To get started with SimplerLLM, follow these steps:

#### **1. Install the Library**

First, install SimplerLLM using `pip`:

```bash
pip install simplerllm
```

#### **2. Set Up Your Environment (.env File)**

To use this library, you need to set several API keys in your environment. Start by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and adding your API keys there.

ðŸ”´ **Important:** This file should be kept private and not committed to version control (e.g., add it to your `.gitignore` file) to protect your keys.

Here is an example of what your `.env` file would look like:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here" # For accessing OpenAI's API
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemeni_api_key_here" # For accessing Gemini's API
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key_here" # For accessing Anthropic's API
RAPIDAPI_API_KEY="your_rapidapi_api_key_here" # For accessing APIs on RapidAPI
VALUE_SERP_API_KEY="your_value_serp_api_key_here" # For Google search
SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_api_key_here" # For Google search
STABILITY_API_KEY="your_stability_api_key_here" # For image generation
```

Each of these keys corresponds to a specific functionality within SimplerLLM. Depending on which features you plan to use, you can add only the relevant keys.
